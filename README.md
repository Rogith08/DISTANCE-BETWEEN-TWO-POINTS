# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
### EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED:
PC Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

### Step 2:
Get the 2 points from the user.

### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula<br>

### Step 4:
Print the distance.

### Step 5:
End the program 

### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points
#Developed by : ROGITH. K

import math
x_1=4
x_2=10
y_1=2
y_2=6
d=math.sqrt(((x_2-x_1)*(x_2-x_1))+((y_2-y_1)*(y_2-y_1) ))
print(format(d,"0.2f"))
```
### OUTPUT:
